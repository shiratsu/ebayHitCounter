# environment

```
PHP 7.3
Laravel 7.0
```

maybe laravel:6.X is fine.


# How to run

at first you should run this.
```
composer install/update
```

either is fine.

Next,
make .env file and set 'EBAY_APP_ID' at .env

## for example

it's ok to copy from .env.example to .env.
then
```
set 'EBAY_APP_ID' at .env
```

then
run application.

```
php artisan serve 
```
